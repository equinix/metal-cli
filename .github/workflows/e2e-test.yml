# This workflow determines whether a PR comes from an external fork
# (which requires approval from us) or from a branch on this repository
# (which means it was made by us and can run immediately).  Once a PR
# is approved, the PR code gains access to secrets referenced in this
# workflow.
# Any changes to this job, even from internal contributors, require
# heavy scrutiny.
